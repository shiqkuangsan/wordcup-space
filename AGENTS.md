# CatPaw Protocol

- This project follows the global CatPaw runtime at `~/.catpaw/`.
- When working with project workflow artifacts, read `~/.catpaw/runtime-policy.md` first.
- When CatPaw routes a task, tell the user the selected `L0`/`L1`/`L2`/`L3` level, short reason, artifact expectation, and verification expectation before meaningful work.
- For CatPaw-routed L1/L2/L3 work, every user-visible checkpoint and final response must include a compact handoff with `Completed`, `Updated artifacts`, `Verification`, `Next`, and `Needs user decision`. L0 stays lightweight unless it escalates or needs a decision.
- Prefer current-tool subagent for medium-risk L1/L2 mapping, consistency, review, QA, or UI/design checks; if skipped after a preference trigger, report `Subagent skipped: <reason>`.
- For frontend or UI-facing work, self-verify with the strongest available interactive surface before user handoff: repo tests, Browser / browser-use / in-app browser for ordinary local web UI, Playwright / Chrome DevTools for reproducible browser evidence, or Computer Use for real-window, OS/native, cross-app, accessibility, browser-extension, profile/session, or browser-automation-unreachable flows. If blocked, report the selected surface, blocker, and remaining gap.
- Project CatPaw artifacts live in this repository's `.catpaw/` directory.
- Use `.catpaw/index.md` as the active work dashboard.
- For project-local CatPaw init, follow `~/.catpaw/commands/init-project.md`.
- For legacy CatPaw artifact migration, follow `~/.catpaw/commands/migrate-project.md`.
- Do not copy global runtime files such as specs, roles, templates, source evidence, or commands into this project.
- Do not delete, move, untrack, or bulk-clean legacy workflow artifacts such as `todos/` without explicit confirmation.
